### Getting Up And Running

**PLEASE KEEP THE AUTHOR INFORMED IF ANY OF THIS CRASHES AND BURNS!**
It can always be a bit fiddly getting things up and running.  Hopefully, this is straight forward enough.

*_Absolute Requirement: JDK 8 or above_*

- Hopefully, you're IDE inclined, as at this time I have not had an opportunity to tidy up and configure Gradle wrappers for you to download and `gradle build install`! 
- Make life easy for yourself - use IntelliJ :-)
